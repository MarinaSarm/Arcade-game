This is a simple online Arcade game. The project made for the [Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](http://udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

To win you should reach the water and avoid collisions with bugs. To start the game:
* Simply press "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT" or "RIGHT" key to move the player.
* If the player collides with the bug, the player will be moved for the beginning position.
* If the player reachs the water (it stayes on the nearest square and you press the "UP" key), the player will be moved for the beginning position.
* Game is lost when the player collides with the bugs 3 times.
